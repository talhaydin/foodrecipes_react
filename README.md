# Food Recipes Website


## Introduction

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is a food recipe website that fetches food recipes from a real API and displays them on a single page application.

Technologies used; HTML, CSS, Javascript, React (Hooks and Styled Components mainly) 

I couldn't get the website working on Netlify for some reason, therefore I will post some pictures here on how it works.

If "See Complete Recipe" button is clicked, website redirects to the recipe source which the owners of this particular API pulled the recipe from.
